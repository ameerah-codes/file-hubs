            <p>Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly two years ago, I've done remote work  for authors, made banners for myself and my friends for bboth business and consumer use. <br>
                The primary area of my interest is undoubtedly front-end. My passion for code started in my 6th year in high school, I'm hoping in the next few years, i'll have the opportunity to work with various companies hence stregthening my development and designing and team work skills.<br>
                I'm quietly confident, naturally curious and always open to learn and understand new concepts, whilst challenging myself and doing intereit things that matter. I'm always willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. <br>
                My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors.
                I'm somewhat of a fast learner, able to pick up new skills relatively easy and juggle different projects with relative ease.
                I've worked with very few selected freelance clients base and I am open to new opportunities. &nbsp;
